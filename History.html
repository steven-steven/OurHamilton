<p style="font-size: 17px"> Hamilton is a port city in the Canadian province of
Ontario. Founded by George Hamilton after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become
the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of
Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe.
 <!--On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation
 of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional
 Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government.
 Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians.--><p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the
   Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Bruce Trail, McMaster University and
    Mohawk College. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside
    Hamilton City Hall and across town to the east, the Canadian Football League's
    Hamilton Tiger-Cats began playing at the new Tim Hortons Field in 2014, which
    was built as part of the 2015 Pan American Games.
Possibly because of its diverse environment, numerous TV and film productions
have been filmed in Hamilton, regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office.
 A growing arts and culture community garnered media attention in 2006 when the Globe
 and Mail published an article called "Go West, Young Artist" about Hamilton's growing art scene.
 The article highlighted local art galleries, recording studios and independent film production.<p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as
   the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario. <p>

<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> In pre-colonial times, the land was mostly used by
  the Neutral Indians but they were gradually driven out by the Iroquois. The land
  was initially settled by United Empire loyalists and were soon followed by many more Americans. </p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> The town of Hamilton was founded by George Hamilton
  when he purchased the farm holdings of James Durand after the War of 1812.
  Initially the town was not an important center. A permanent jail was not even constructed
  until 1832 when a cut-stone design was completed on one of the two squares
  created in 1816, Prince's Square. Subsequently, the first police board and then
  town limits were defined by statute on February 13, 1833. Official City status
   was achieved on June 9, 1846 by an act of Parliament.

<h2><strong>Development</strong></h2>

<img style="float:right; width: 500px; height:200px" src="/Images/146393_3.jpg">
<p style="font-size:17px"> As the city grew, so did the number of prominent buildings
  including the Grand Lodge of Canada which was constructed in 1855. The West
  Flamoro Methodist Church was founded by 1879, a public library in 1890 and the
  Right House department store in 1893. The first commercial telephone service in Canada,
  the first telephone exchange in the British Empire and the second telephone exchange in all of
  North America, were all established in the city between 1877-1878. Even though the city
  suffered through the Hamilton Street Railway strike of 1906, the industrial bussinesses kept
  expanding as did the population. Two steel manufacturing companies started on 1910 and 1912.
  Population growth had continued until around the 1960s. Most of the large industries have shut down or moved away
  by now and the economy has shifted more towards the service sector. On January 1, 2001, the city of Hamilton
  was formed from the amalgamation of Hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities: Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough,
  Glanbrook, and Stoney Creek. Before amalgamation, the "old" City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided
  into 100 neighbourhoods. The amalgamation created a single-tier municipal government, ending subsidization of its suburbs.
  The new amalgamated city has 519,949 people in over 100 old neighbourhoods, and surrounding communities.
